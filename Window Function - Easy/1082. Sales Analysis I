# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT seller_id
FROM
(SELECT seller_id, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(price) DESC) AS rk
FROM Sales
GROUP BY seller_id) sub
WHERE rk = 1

#Dense_rank() return ranking without 'hole'
#it can be also solved with sub-query: select the highest price, then select sellers whose selling prices are equal to the highest price.
