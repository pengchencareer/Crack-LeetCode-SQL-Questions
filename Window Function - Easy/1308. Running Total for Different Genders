# Write your MySQL query statement below

#1. Self-join -> set condition: s2.day <= s1.day and s1.g = s2.g -> group by -> sum
SELECT s1.gender AS gender, s1.day AS day, SUM(s2.score_points) AS total
FROM Scores s1 JOIN Scores s2
ON s1.gender = s2.gender
WHERE s2.day <= s1.day
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2

#2. Window function - running total: order by
SELECT gender, day, 
       SUM(score_points) OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY day) AS total
FROM Scores

#if without 'order by day', it will return the same result for each row inside of a gender.
