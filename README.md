LC SQL Questions Summary & Instruction
------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are ALL the solutions of SQL questions in LeetCode. They are grouped into different folders mainly based on their category and complexity.
The main purpose of the repository is for self-leanring and self-instruction for those who want to learn SQL quickly and those who want to crach SQL interviews.
Hence, the instruction and thinking flow for each question will be provided and it is underway. For all the 149 questions until Feb 17, 2021, some of them are similar questions and can be analyzed and solved in the same way, so typically I will add notes for 2 things: what is the biggest challenge for the question and how to crack it.
