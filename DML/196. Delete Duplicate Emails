#1. Weird solution
DELETE p1 FROM Person p1,
    Person p2
WHERE
    p1.Email = p2.Email AND p1.Id > p2.Id

2. Sub query 
DELETE 
FROM Person 
WHERE Id NOT IN
(SELECT *
FROM
(SELECT MIN(Id)
FROM Person 
GROUP BY Email
) t
)

#Select the minimum id for each email
#Select those IDs not in the 'minimum id, email' group
