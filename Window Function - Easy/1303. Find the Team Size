# Write your MySQL query statement below
#1. With CTE -> get the team size for each team, and then join the team size with employee_id by team_id.
# WITH tb1 AS
# (SELECT team_id, COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) AS team_size
# FROM Employee
# GROUP BY team_id)

# SELECT employee_id, team_size
# FROM Employee e JOIN tb1
# ON e.team_id = tb1.team_id

#2. Windows function -> Partition by team_id

Select employee_id,
COUNT(employee_id) OVER(PARTITION BY team_id) AS team_size
FROM Employee
